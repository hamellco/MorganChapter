In this talk, Larry Naylor will discuss strategies for taking photographs of small archaeological artifacts for presentations, reports, and publication using digital photography and Photoshop for processing images. Lighting techniques, positioning, backgrounds, and scales are important for accurate documentation of artifacts.  Photographing lithics, ceramics, glass, coins, metal objects, and skeletal material will be demonstrated throughout the presentation.
