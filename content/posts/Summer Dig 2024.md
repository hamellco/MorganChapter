# Announcing the 2024 Summer Excavation Opportunity!
 
**Location:** Selby Howard Site, Pumpkin Hook, Farmington, New York  
**Dates:** Saturday and Sunday, July 20th and 21st and Saturday and Sunday, July 27th and 28th 
 
**Description:** The Morgan Chapter will be excavating at the Selby Howard site in Pumpkin Hook located near 1816 Quaker Meeting House, which is a hamlet of Farmington, NY. The site is associated with an African American man who escaped from slavery in 1850. With his wife Harriett he bought a one-acre farm in 1855 for $120 cash. That farm is located a short distance from the site we will be working at. The excavation site is where he ended his days ‘in a cabin in the woods’, according to the Ontario County Times dated December 7, 1881. Selby Howard died in 1885 and lies buried in the cemetery of the 1816 Quaker Meeting House. The chapter excavation will investigate an area which may be the remains of the house in the woods as well as a barn foundation situated near the main road and to recover artifacts that may date them.
