Beginning in 2010 the Lewis Henry Morgan Chapter, of the New York State Archaeological Association, has sponsored a fieldwork program at the site of Burning Springs. During the 17th century, the Seneca Iroquois brought the French explorer, LaSalle to Burning Springs and set the spring on fire as a demonstration. The water contains dissolved natural gas which allows it to burn. In the early 19th century, the site was settled by farmers, and for a period of time, it was turned into a park. During the first season we surveyed three areas and expected to find traces of human activity spanning late prehistory through modern times. No prehistoric deposits were found. But during the past four field seasons we have uncovered a large midden near the 19th century house that is still standing, another previously unknown 19th century foundation up on the hill and possible traces of another structure. Documentary research has traced the owners of the properties and linked them to living descendants in the town.
